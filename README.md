## Welcome to your workspace
This is your dedicated coding environment complete with C compiler and debugger

The `main.c` is where you modify your C code that we'll reach the goal of: **Create a C program that identifies and displays prime numbers within a user-defined range.**

Since this is a VS code based environment, you don't need to relearn everything. This instance runs on Ubuntu Linux, and comes with command line applications such as `gcc` (the C compiler). You don't need to know many technical aspects of this instance, but remember this is not a Windows-based environment where some apps like `cmd.exe` doesn't exist here.

## Workspace information and sharing
This is your workspace with your own files including the other member's files so you can synchronize their work to yours and make changes.

The file you need to focus on is `main.c` which this is the main C program. Just write some code and carry on, its also automatically autosaved and periodically pushed to GitHub for versioning.

You can see other's files **in real time** but not edit them... To provide the same experience as Google docs but optimized for coding environment. Attempting to edit or modify your other member's files will result an error, so you can focus editing your code worry free.

**As much as possible: DO NOT EDIT `.gitignore` and `.vscode` files!!**

## Compiling and Running your program
In the `main.c` file. If you need to see, test, or debug your changes. Just press F5 to compile and run the program, sometimes it may not always print the desired output, if that's the case press F5 again, if it doesn't, let the leader know.

Alternatively, open Terminal and run these commands to compile and run your code to see the output.
```console
gcc main.c -o main.exe
./main.exe
```
